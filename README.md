Branching strategy:
i will be using the github flow branching strategy in all ofthe projects, this strategy works as follows:
step 1: when want to make changes or fix bugs a new branch is made out of the main branch 
Step 2: Commit my work to the new Feature branch locally
Step 3: when the feature is completely developed a pull request will be created
Step 4: once the work has been reviewed the feature branch will be merged with the main branch
Step 5: once merged and pushed to the main, it is immediatly deployable

Gitignore:
I might make use of the gitignore file to ignore files that are unchange through out the project but is uploaded along with the commit, so that i do not have multiple of the same files in one repository
